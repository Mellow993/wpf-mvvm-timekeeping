# wpf-mvvm-timekeeping
This small wpf application helps me to trace my daily worktime.
It's an anyoing and time consuming task to write down the daily
work time manually.
Of course I'm aware of the fact that you can realize the same task in 
Excel in a shorter amount of time, but the main goal was to get familiar with C#
and the MVVM pattern.

When you got any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contact me.
Otherwise you can use it for your own.
